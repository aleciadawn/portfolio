          <br>
          <div>The client was a local gym looking to modernize their website and branding. They were looking for a clean, easy-to-use, research-based website that would help drive membership and appeal to a younger audience.

        <div>
          I wanted to pair a strong powerful typeface with a clean and modern one. I chose to pair Abolition with Monsterrat Extra Light.

        <br>
        <h5 class="text-tan">Color Palette</h6>
          <div>
I chose the color palette based on the old logo which is still on the sign outside of the gym. Black is the predominant color of the site with the others following as accent colors.          </div>
<br>
          <h5 class="text-tan">Logo</h6>
            <div class="pb-5">
Similar to the color palette, the logo design was a modernization of the previous logo. I opted to stick with a slab-serif as a nod to the 1980s origin of the gym. I went with a thin, wide, italicized font for "fitness center" to contrast the powerful boldness of "Health Plex".            </div>

              Next, I sent out a survey to both members and non-members. The survey received responses from 12 non-members and six members. Of the non-members surveyed, three did not have any type of gym membership. Based on the findings of the survey along with 3 personal interviews, I analyzed the original site to identify the main pain points and made sure to prioritze those points throughout my design process.

My priority was to understand each user's motivation to go to the gym, and how my site design could increase the chances of them not only joining, but continue to show up and stay long-term members. After creating the personas, I outlined user stories to meet the needs of each persona, prioritizing the needs that overlapped the most.</div>

              I used color coding to identify the user interaction with the sitemap and highlighted the top page priorities based on the user research.
              The low-fidelity wireframes were created using Balsamiq, and once I had those complete,
              I moved on to incorporate the style guide and created high-fidelity wireframes using Sketch.

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <h6 class="text-mauve">PROTOTYPING | USER TESTING | DEVELOPMENT</h6>
            <div>
              I used InVision to create a site prototype and observed users navigating the site. I began the observation with the following prompt:
              <br><br>
              <span class="bold-text">"Pretend you have just moved to a new city and are looking to join a gym, use this site to determine whether you would consider this gym as a top contender."</span>
              <br><br>
              After taking notes of their first moves I checked to see if their priorities aligned with the research done at the beginning of the process.
              Then, I had each user move through tasks I created from the user flows. Here are some examples of tasks I asked the users:
              <br><br>
              <span class="bold-text">1. "Identify a fitness class you would like to attend and tell me how much it would cost you if you attended as a member."</span>
              <br>
              <span class="bold-text">2. "Tell me if the cost of membership is in your price range"</span>
              <br>
              <span class="bold-text">3. "You are hoping to hire a personal trainer, how would you go about getting a trainer from this gym"</span>
              <br>
              <span class="bold-text">4. "Sign-up for a free-trial."</span>
              <br><br>

              Overall, the feedback was positive. There were a few minor design changes which included redesigning a couple pieces of content that a few users thought were buttons when they were not.
